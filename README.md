# Blaan Dialect Identification & Translation — Web Version

A web-based implementation of our thesis project: an NLP system capable of identifying dialects (including Blaan) from user-input text and providing basic translation features.
This project focuses on learning how to integrate a machine learning model into a web environment, converting the original mobile-based prototype into a browser-accessible application.

## Features

### Dialect Identification
Detects dialects such as:
Blaan Gensan
Blaan Polomolok
Blaan Sarangani

### Basic Translation System
Provides simple translations between supported dialects (limited vocabulary/scope as per original ML model).

### Model Integration in Web
Demonstrates how to load and run a trained NLP model in a real web system.

### Simple, Clean UI
Designed for easy input and fast evaluation.
